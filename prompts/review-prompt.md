## Example Review Response

### Overall Assessment
**REQUEST_CHANGES** - Several issues need to be addressed before merge.

### Specific Issues

#### Critical Issues
1. **Security**: Missing input validation on user registration
   - **Description**: Email field accepts any string without validation
   - **Suggestion**: Add email format validation using Pydantic EmailStr
   - **Location**: `backend/api/v1/users.py:45`

2. **Performance**: N+1 query problem in team member list
   - **Description**: Each team member triggers separate database query
   - **Suggestion**: Use joinedload to fetch members in single query
   - **Location**: `backend/services/team_service.py:78`

#### High Priority Issues
3. **Code Quality**: Missing error handling in API endpoint
   - **Description**: Database connection errors not handled
   - **Suggestion**: Add try-catch block with proper error logging
   - **Location**: `backend/api/v1/todos.py:23`

#### Medium Priority Issues
4. **Testing**: Insufficient test coverage for edge cases
   - **Description**: Only happy path scenarios tested
   - **Suggestion**: Add tests for invalid inputs and error conditions
   - **Location**: `backend/tests/test_todos.py`

#### Low Priority Issues
5. **Documentation**: Missing API documentation
   - **Description**: New endpoint not documented in OpenAPI
   - **Suggestion**: Add proper docstring with examples
   - **Location**: `backend/api/v1/posts.py:67`

### Suggestions
1. **Performance**: Consider implementing Redis caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Security**: Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Testing**: Implement property-based testing for complex validation logic
4. **Documentation**: Add more examples in API documentation

### Questions
1. Should we implement soft delete for todos instead of hard delete?
2. Do we need to add audit logging for user actions?
3. Should we implement pagination for the team member list?
